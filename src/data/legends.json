    "backstory": "When Alter emerged from her dimension into another (with her past held close to the chest), she had only two things: her interdimensional traveling Void tech, and a desire to have fun. She stole the fanciest of foods, learned to fight through dicey situations, and took on odd jobs for personal favors - though she didn't have a problem double-crossing her clients if it was more beneficial or amusing. Never needing to stick around for the consequences of her actions eroded any sense of morality or responsibility she had. She could focus on what was important: making sure life was never mundane.\n\nAlter was drawn to worlds on the edge of complete destruction. Whether something devastating was already happening or she helped usher in the apocalypse herself, she was there to watch whatever catastrophe ensued. It was only in those moments, after all, that people took off the masks they always wore and she could see their true selves.\n\nFinding these world-ending events was a toss up. Sometimes she'd find what she was looking for, and on others, she'd have missed the main event in worlds already ruined. But in some of these ruined worlds, Alter began to notice an interesting commonality…\n\nMany of these worlds hadn't met their end by some random event; they had been destroyed by the same person.",

After an encounter with Horizon that overrides Ash's simulacrum programming, the framework that kept the vulnerable--yet intelligent--Leigh personality dormant has begun to crack. Ash joins the Games to prove she has transcended all humanity. Leigh's determined to prove her wrong.",

Wealthy, furious and self-destructive, August joined the Thunderdome Games (the pre-Apex Apex Games). Here, he took the name Ballistic and became a sensation! His style was wild, reckless, and utterly selfish⁠, helping him become the very first Thunderdome celebrity. \n\nHe was famed for his iconic CAR (“Lady Grey”, for the tea). It was here, in combat, that August would meet the love of his life, Sok Leng. They would quickly marry and have a son, Nathaniel. Sok Leng and her brother Kit Siang were an inseparable duo of destruction, and with August now in their squad, they seemed unstoppable. \n\nBut nothing lasts forever. August’s crowd-pandering combat style meant he wasn’t paying attention to his team when they needed him, leading to Kit Siang’s death. Devastated by guilt, August retreated into himself, driving away his wife and son. For nearly two decades, August lived as a recluse, keeping busy with small tasks to distract a lonely mind. And so August was largely forgotten, though not by everyone. His son, Nathaniel, was both enamored with his father’s victories and determined to surpass them. When his son qualified to join the dangerous Apex Games, August went to the Syndicate with an offer: take me instead. \n\nHis son would be safe from the path that ruined him. What better way to use those skills than in selfless service? And if it just so happens to be his favorite activity, killing all who stand against him…That’s quite the fortunate coincidence.",

Shortly after, Anita and Jackson left to begin their quest back home– or so she thought. \n\nA few years later, on another ship nicknamed the IMS Hestia II, Anita and Jackson were attacked by unknown assailants. A bomb on the outer hull blew out a chunk of the ship… but not before Jackson shielded her, sacrificing his own life to save hers. Anita watched helplessly, as Jackson was sucked out into the vacuum of space. After crashing on the Syndicate planet Solace, Anita looked for both work and the brother she refused to believe had died, so they could begin the decades-long trip back home. \n\nShe started fighting in the Games in the hopes of earning the money and finding a pilot willing to take the epic trip back home to reunite with what remains of her family, but was shocked to find Jackson alive and living a new life. Now that Anita and Jackson are reunited in the Games, she plans to work through her relationship with her estranged brother and support her new chosen family–the Legends.",

Instead, she was more at home with fellow misfits who spent their time on crystal readings, moon rituals and personal witchery–they supported her through her self-discovery and transition, making her turbulent teenage years easier and less lonely. But when her closest friend went to extreme lengths to save their moon from corporate encroachment, Tressa was caught in the middle. Ultimately, she ran away from home, finding solace in the one place her friend cared about most: their moon, Cleo. \n\nThere she joined the terraforming crews hired to repair and rejuvenate the celestial body.

The child of wealthy war profiteers, she left home when she learned of the damage her family had caused and enlisted in the Frontier Corps, a humanitarian organization that aids Frontier communities in need. She’s since devoted her life to helping others and joined the Apex Games to give more funds to those in need.\n\nSince no one in the Games is innocent — they all know what they signed up for — and every one of her victories means help for those in need, Lifeline has no problem engaging in the popular bloodsport. Or so she tells herself. She may seem sarcastic and callous, but deep down she wants to help people and make the world a better place. If that means taking a few people down in the process, so be it.\n\nBut when a rift in reality swallows her loyal health drone, D.O.C., Lifeline reaches into it, sacrificing her own hand and barely managing to pull D.O.C. back to reality. Instead of crumpling under the weight of the universe, Lifeline “repairs” her damaged hand with cybernetic implants, then rebuilds D.O.C. better than ever.\n\nNow, Lifeline’s days of getting pulled into chaotic events are over. She’ll throw herself into them headfirst, on her–and D.O.C.’s–own terms.",

He knew he would never be safe from the remnants of the IMC--and neither would his sister, Anita, as long as she was with him. So when he was presumed dead in a ship explosion, he used that opportunity to leave his life behind, even if it meant leaving her behind too.\n\nYears later, “Lamont” moved to an idyllic little town called Harris Valley, where he fell in love and got married. Harris Valley was so peaceful that they didn’t need law enforcement. All they needed was their knight, Newcastle. But the knight had secrets of his own: Newcastle had sold off the town to pay off his debts, and thugs from a gang called the Forgotten Families came to collect. They killed Newcastle when he couldn’t pay, unaware that Lamont was watching. He defeated them using his military acumen, but the Forgotten Families had plenty of reinforcements.\n\nSo Lamont came up with a dangerous solution. With Newcastle’s armor, he could take on his identity and do what Newcastle could not: get into the Apex Games. With prize money like that, he could definitely pay off the debts.

His skills and confidence are seen as a blessing and a curse to the group, because every trait that would make him a great potential leader is also seen as a liability by the old guard. Enea had been the clear successor of the head of the order, but he refused to see the world in such binary terms, and as he grew older his family felt increasingly concerned over his resistance to their views. Being raised by such a tightly-wound group made him restless, often leading him to make reckless decisions.\n\nOne particularly reckless action of Enea’s created a rift his family could not see a way back from, and it became clear that Enea and his family would never see eye to eye on Clessidra Rossa’s black-and-white approach to life. Unable to convince his family that some situations don’t have an obvious right and wrong, Enea was shunned from his family and the Clessidra Rossa.\n\nEnea is heartbroken about leaving his family, but is determined to figure out how to have it all—both a life on his own terms and his family’s acceptance. While bounty hunting on his own to support himself, an unexpected bystander recruited him for the Apex Games—The perfect playground to flex his skills and have fun at the same time.

    "backstory": "Xiomara “Mara” Contreras was born and raised alone on the wild ice planet Págos by her survivalist mother, Xenia. Mara proved gifted with a sniper rifle from the moment she was big enough to look through the scope and reach the trigger at the same time. The tight-lipped Xenia could only get her chatty daughter to stop asking questions by giving her a scavenged copy of Encyclopedia Outlandica, which Mara memorized front to back.\n\nWhen Mara was 18, she discovered the wreck of the G.D.S. Vantage. Against her mother’s wishes, Mara snuck in, only to learn that she had been lied to. Her mother hadn’t grown up on Págos: she was brought there on the G.D.S. Vantage as a prisoner. Disturbed by the intrusion, the ship collapsed into a crevasse, trapping a wounded Mara. Her mother only found her after a baby bat Mara had rescued circled the crevasse holding Mara’s signature whistle. By the time Xenia got to her daughter, the injuries were too severe for her to treat. To save her daughter’s life, Xenia set off the prison ship’s SOS beacon, but was imprisoned once more in return.\n\nOnce Mara had healed, she visited her mother in jail, promising to find a way to get her out. But Xenia begged Mara not to, fearful that Mara would wind up in prison beside her. It would break her heart to see her daughter share her fate, so Xenia told her daughter to get back to Págos and forget about her.\n\nBut Mara would not. At a loss for what to do, unable to return to her planet, and unable to fit into society, Mara’s eye turned to the Apex Games. In it, she saw a situation she understood--survival--and a platform to draw public attention to Xenia’s case. With raised awareness of her wrongful conviction, she took the moniker Vantage to rally support and pressure those in power to set her mother free.",

Daughter of the Games’ lead electrical engineer, she studied his manuals to stay close to him, and discovered her calling at a young age. Though she could be completely distracted one moment and hyper-focused the next, electricity grounded her – its ordered, predictable flow made sense in a way the rest of the world didn’t.\n\nShe devoured every book she could on the subject, and eventually became such a skilled engineer that she was commissioned to build the Apex Games’ Modified Containment Ring. Unfortunately, her father died the day it was revealed, leaving her alone. At her lowest moment, a group of competitors invited her to return to the arena with them, assuring her she would always have a home. She now fights alongside her friends in the arena she helped build, destroying incoming missiles, recharging shields, creating fences, and using her pylon to silence fights that get too loud. Nobody knows the arena better than Wattson - anyone who underestimates her is in for a shock.",

    "backstory": "Wraith is a whirlwind fighter, able to execute deadly attacks and manipulate spacetime by opening rifts in the fabric of reality — but those abilities came at a price. Years ago, she woke up in an IMC detention facility with no memory of who she was. Senior Science Pilot Renee Blasey, who volunteered as guinea pig for her own experiments... whose partner betrayed her and locked her away… no longer existed. All that was left was a timid girl, frightened by a cacophony of voices in her head, until another version of herself appeared and taught her to listen to the voices. Following her lead, Wraith found the strength to break free from her prison and escape into a different reality - this reality.\n\nFinally free, but still robbed of her memories, Wraith continues her quest to learn more about who she was before the experiments. With so many of the Apex Games held on old IMC bases, Wraith now competes so she can access the mysterious facilities and continue to learn more about who she was. She remains a fixture of the Apex Games, and with every match she gets closer to the truth, even if she sometimes feels scared to find out more about who she used to be.",
